# FidoVault

FidoVault is a tool to control access to secrets via symmetric encryption and decryption using hardware [FIDO2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDO_Alliance#FIDO2) keys. A FidoVault vault file contains a secret encrypted via one or more FIDO2 keys, such that the secret is inaccessible without at least one of the keys, but any single key can decrypt the secret. A password can optionally be required for decryption in addition to a key.

> [!CAUTION]
> Most FIDO2 keys cannot be "backed up" or duplicated. If all the keys of a particular FidoVault are lost (or (presumably - I have not tested this) ["reset"u](https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016648899-Resetting-the-FIDO2-Application-on-Your-YubiKey-or-Security-Key)), then that FidoVault will become irreversibly inaccessible.
>
> Additionally, FIDO2 keys apparently have two separate secret keys, one used when ["user verification" (`userVerification` or `uv`)](https://developers.yubico.com/WebAuthn/WebAuthn_Developer_Guide/User_Presence_vs_User_Verification.html) is performed, and the other when it is not. Consequently, secrets encrypted by a key when user verification is not performed may not be accessible by the same key when user verification is performed (and vice versa). For more detailed discussion of this issue and its implications, see [here](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/discussions/9506#discussioncomment-11864543).

## Hardware

Any hardware FIDO2 key that supports the [HMAC Secret Extension](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.0-id-20180227/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.0-id-20180227.html#sctn-hmac-secret-extension) (which [reportedly most do](https://0pointer.net/blog/unlocking-luks2-volumes-with-tpm2-fido2-pkcs11-security-hardware-on-systemd-248.html)) should work with FidoVault. Development and testing have primarily been done using a [Yubico Security Key](https://www.yubico.com/products/security-key/).

## Dependencies

FidoVault is written in Python 3, and has the following dependencies:

 * [Cryptography](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography) (for symmetric encryption and decryption of secrets)
 * [python-fido2 version 1.2.0](https://github.com/Yubico/python-fido2/releases/tag/1.2.0) (for accessing FIDO2 keys)
 
> [!NOTE]
> Be sure to use version 1.2.0 of python-fido2; FidoVault will not work correctly with earlier versions.

## Usage

Initialize a FidoVault:

```
$ fidovault.py -i -v <vaultname>
Enter secret: 
Confirm secret: 
Prompt for passwords to combine with FIDO2 hmac-secrets? (y/n - default is y) y
Please connect the FIDO2 key you wish to add (and disconnect any others).
Press <enter> when ready ... 
Checking key at /dev/hidraw1 ...
Key supports the hmac-secret extension.
Making FIDO2 credential ... 
Touch your authenticator device now ...
Success.
Getting hmac-secret ... 
Touch your authenticator device now ...
Success.
Enter password (leave blank for none): 
Confirm password: 
Enter name for this key: Blue Key
FIDO2 key successfully added.
FidoVault '<vaultname>' updated.
```

Add an additional key to an existing FidoVault (connect an already configured FIDO2 key before proceeding):

```
$ fidovault.py -a -v <vaultname>
Checking key at /dev/hidraw1 ...
Key supports the hmac-secret extension.
Touch your authenticator device now ...
Enter password (leave blank for none): 
Attempting to decrypt token of 'Blue Key' ...
Token decryption succeeded.
Please connect the FIDO2 key you wish to add (and disconnect any others).
Press <enter> when ready ... 
Checking key at /dev/hidraw1 ...
Key supports the hmac-secret extension.
Making FIDO2 credential ... 
Touch your authenticator device now ...
Success.
Getting hmac-secret ... 
Touch your authenticator device now ...
Success.
Enter password (leave blank for none): 
Confirm password: 
Enter name for this key: Red Key
FIDO2 key successfully added.
FidoVault '<vaultname> updated.
```

Print a FidoVault secret:

```
$ fidovault.py -v <vaultname>
Checking key at /dev/hidraw1 ...
Key supports the hmac-secret extension.
Touch your authenticator device now ...
Enter password (leave blank for none): 
Attempting to decrypt token of 'Blue Key' ...
Token decryption succeeded.
<secret>
```

### Providing a FidoVault secret to another program

FidoVault is designed to be used in conjunction with other programs, by providing a secret to them. For programs that accept a secret on `STDIN`, simply pipe FidoVault's `STDOUT` to them (all FidoVault user interaction output is written to `STDERR` / `/dev/tty`, and so will be printed to the terminal and not redirected to the other program). E.g., to use a FidoVault secret for symmetric encryption [and decryption](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/560135/how-to-decrypt-file-that-was-symmetrically-encrypted-using-gpg) of a file with [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/), run:

```
$ fidovault.py -v <vaultname> | gpg --passphrase-fd 0 --pinentry-mode loopback -c <filename>
```

and:

```
$ fidovault.py -v <vaultname> | gpg --passphrase-fd 0 --pinentry-mode loopback --output <filename> -d <filename.gpg>
```

To open a [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) database with a FidoVault secret as password, run:

```
$ fidovault.py -v <vaultname> | keepassxc --pw-stdin /path/to/database.kdbx
```

(Unfortunately, [this only works if KeePassXC is not currently running](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/8826).)

For programs that expect a secret as an argument, FidoVault can pass a secret to them via [`xargs`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xargs). E.g., to open a KeePassXC database with a FidoVault secret as password [via D-Bus](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/wiki/Using-DBus-with-KeePassXC) when KeePassXC is already running, run:

```
$ fidovault.py -v <vaultname> | xargs qdbus org.keepassxc.KeePassXC.MainWindow /keepassxc org.keepassxc.KeePassXC.MainWindow.openDatabase /path/to/database.kdbx
```

(On Debian Sid, replace `qdbus` with `qdbus6`.)

To pass the secret at a position other than the end of the command, use the `-I replace-str` argument of `xargs`. E.g., to open a KeePassXC database with a FidoVault secret as a password plus a keyfile that resides somewhere in the filesystem via D-Bus, run:

```
$ fidovault.py -v <vaultname> | xargs -I % qdbus org.keepassxc.KeePassXC.MainWindow /keepassxc org.keepassxc.KeePassXC.MainWindow.openDatabase /path/to/database.kdbx % /path/to/keyfile
```

:warning: Including a secret in a command's arguments is generally considered insecure, since the secret will be visible to anyone with access to the system process list. The above `qdbus` command is [additionally insecure since it will place the secret on the D-Bus message bus, which also may be accessible to others](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/8826).

## Background

The original motivation of FidoVault was the desire to implement a standalone tool to [open KeePassXC databases with FIDO2 keys](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/discussions/9506), but the code quickly evolved into a more general purpose tool. FidoVault's basic architecture was inspired by the discussion [here](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/discussions/9506), as well as the design of [LUKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup) plus its [systemd-cryptenroll extension](https://0pointer.net/blog/unlocking-luks2-volumes-with-tpm2-fido2-pkcs11-security-hardware-on-systemd-248.html). Indeed, I seriously contemplated using LUKS + systemd-cryptenroll (possibly with loop devices) as a general purpose FIDO2-protected secret store, but since LUKS is designed around block devices and the [device mapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_mapper), it cannot be easily used by non-root users.

Other projects similar to FidoVault (which I encountered after implementing FidoVault):

 * [khefin](https://github.com/mjec/khefin) ([abandoned a couple of years ago](https://github.com/mjec/khefin/issues/42))
 * [tokenring](https://github.com/glyph/tokenring)

## Donations
