# FidoVault

FidoVault is a tool to control access to secrets via symmetric encryption and decryption using [FIDO2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDO_Alliance#FIDO2) authenticators. A FidoVault vault file contains a secret encrypted via one or more FIDO2 authenticators, such that the secret is inaccessible without at least one of the authenticators, but any single authenticator can decrypt the secret. A password can optionally be required for decryption in addition to an authenticator.

> [!CAUTION]
> Most FIDO2 authenticators cannot be "backed up" or duplicated. If all the authenticators of a particular FidoVault are lost (or ["reset"](https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016648899-Resetting-the-FIDO2-Application-on-Your-YubiKey-or-Security-Key)), then that FidoVault will become permanently inaccessible.
>
> Additionally, [when FIDO2 authenticators make a credential, they generate two random values, `credRandomWithUV` and `credRandomWithoutUV`, and associate them with the credential](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.1-rd-20210309/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.1-rd-20210309.html#sctn-hmac-secret-extension). In the context of an assertion, the former is used when ["user verification"](https://developers.yubico.com/WebAuthn/WebAuthn_Developer_Guide/User_Presence_vs_User_Verification.html) (most commonly via the entry of a PIN) is performed and the latter when it is not. Consequently, secrets encrypted by an authenticator when user verification is not performed will not be able to be decrypted by the same authenticator when user verification is performed (and vice versa). For more detailed discussion of this issue and its implications, see [here](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/discussions/9506#discussioncomment-11864543).

## Hardware

Any standard [USB](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.1-rd-20210309/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.1-rd-20210309.html#usb) authenticator that supports the [HMAC Secret Extension](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.0-id-20180227/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.0-id-20180227.html#sctn-hmac-secret-extension) (which [reportedly most do](https://0pointer.net/blog/unlocking-luks2-volumes-with-tpm2-fido2-pkcs11-security-hardware-on-systemd-248.html)) should work with FidoVault. [NFC](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.1-rd-20210309/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.1-rd-20210309.html#nfc) and [Bluetooth](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.1-rd-20210309/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.1-rd-20210309.html#nfc) authenticators have not been tested, and PC/SC authenticators are not currently supported. Development and testing have primarily been done using a [Yubico Security Key](https://www.yubico.com/products/security-key/).

## Dependencies

FidoVault is written in Python 3, and has the following dependencies:

 * [`cryptography`](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography) (for symmetric encryption and decryption of secrets)
 * [`python-fido2` version 1.2.0](https://github.com/Yubico/python-fido2/releases/tag/1.2.0) (for accessing FIDO2 authenticators)
 
> [!NOTE]
> Be sure to use version 1.2.0 of `python-fido2`; FidoVault will not work correctly with earlier versions.

FidoVault should work on any platform on which Python 3 and the above dependencies can be installed, although running under Windows may require administrator privileges, since [Windows apparently requires](https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016648939-Troubleshooting-Failed-connecting-to-the-YubiKey-Make-sure-the-application-has-the-required-permissions-in-YubiKey-Manager) [administrator privileges](https://docs.yubico.com/yesdk/yubikey-api/Yubico.YubiKey.YubiKeyDevice.FindByTransport.html) [for certain FIDO APIs](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/11400).


## Usage

Display usage instructions:

```
$ fidovault.py -h

Create and manage FidoVaults - control access to secrets via symmetric encryption and decryption using FIDO2 authenticators.

options:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -v, --vault VAULT  FidoVault location

  -i, --init         initialize a FidoVault
  -a, --add          add a key section to a FidoVault

If neither '--init' nor '--add' are specified, the program will attempt to output the FidoVault's secret to STDOUT.
```

```

### Providing a FidoVault secret to another program

FidoVault is designed to be used in conjunction with other programs, by providing a secret to them. For programs that accept a secret on `STDIN`, simply pipe FidoVault's `STDOUT` to them (all FidoVault user interaction output is written to `STDERR` / `/dev/tty`, and so will be printed to the terminal and not redirected to the other program). E.g., to use a FidoVault secret for symmetric encryption [and decryption](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/560135/how-to-decrypt-file-that-was-symmetrically-encrypted-using-gpg) of a file with [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/), run:

```
$ fidovault.py -v <vaultname> | gpg --passphrase-fd 0 --pinentry-mode loopback -c <filename>
```

and:

```
$ fidovault.py -v <vaultname> | gpg --passphrase-fd 0 --pinentry-mode loopback --output <filename> -d <filename.gpg>
```

To open a [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) database with a FidoVault secret as password, run:

```
$ fidovault.py -v <vaultname> | keepassxc --pw-stdin /path/to/database.kdbx
```

(Unfortunately, [this only works if KeePassXC is not currently running](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/2089).)

For programs that expect a secret as an argument, FidoVault can pass a secret to them via [`xargs`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xargs). E.g., to open a KeePassXC database with a FidoVault secret as password [via D-Bus](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/wiki/Using-DBus-with-KeePassXC) when KeePassXC is already running, run:

```
$ fidovault.py -v <vaultname> | xargs qdbus org.keepassxc.KeePassXC.MainWindow /keepassxc org.keepassxc.KeePassXC.MainWindow.openDatabase /path/to/database.kdbx
```

(On Debian Sid, replace `qdbus` with `qdbus6`.)

To pass the secret at a position other than the end of the command, use the `-I replace-str` argument of `xargs`. E.g., to open a KeePassXC database with a FidoVault secret as a password plus a keyfile that resides somewhere in the filesystem via D-Bus, run:

```
$ fidovault.py -v <vaultname> | xargs -I % qdbus org.keepassxc.KeePassXC.MainWindow /keepassxc org.keepassxc.KeePassXC.MainWindow.openDatabase /path/to/database.kdbx % /path/to/keyfile
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Including a secret in a command's arguments is generally considered insecure, since the secret will be visible to anyone with access to the system process list. The above `qdbus` command is [additionally insecure since it will place the secret on the D-Bus message bus, which also may be accessible to others](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/8826).

## Background

The original motivation of FidoVault was the desire to implement a standalone tool to [open KeePassXC databases with FIDO2 authenticators](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/discussions/9506), but the code quickly evolved into a more general purpose tool. FidoVault's basic architecture was inspired by the discussion [here](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/discussions/9506), as well as the design of [LUKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup) plus its [systemd-cryptenroll extension](https://0pointer.net/blog/unlocking-luks2-volumes-with-tpm2-fido2-pkcs11-security-hardware-on-systemd-248.html). Indeed, I seriously contemplated using LUKS + systemd-cryptenroll (possibly with loop devices) as a general purpose FIDO2-protected secret store, but since LUKS is designed around block devices and the [device mapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_mapper), it cannot be easily used by non-root users.
